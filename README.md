# Eye Excersise
This project consists of a set of objects which are layered to create the appearance of a set of eyes wherein the user directs the movement of the pupils via mouse movement.
The majority of the code for this project was provided by Dr. John Williams for this student's use pursuant to the completion of MIT xPRO's Professional Certificate in Coding: Fullstack Development with MERN course. All errors are my own.

## How to Run
This project can be run in a chromium browser - download and extract this repo from the zip file and open the .html file to view. Dependencies are limited to the eyes.js script and eyes.css files.

# Roadmap for Future Improvements
* Addition of eyelids which will set blinking animation at a given interval
